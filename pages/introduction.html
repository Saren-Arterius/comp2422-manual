      <p class="flow-text">The HYPERSPHERE is a cutting edge fitness and recovery device that uses pressure and vibration to improve the bodyâ€™s overall performance.</p>
      <h2 class="header">Technology</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">Keeping the body's soft tissue (muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia) loose is essential for maintaining flexibility and range of motion. While myofascial therapy balls can help the body stay loose, adding vibration with the intensity and frequency
        of the HYPERSPHERE takes the whole experience to another level. The HYPERSPHERE has been used by the world s best athletes to warm up and recover from training and competition, and can be used by anyone who wants to move better. The HYPERSPHERE
        is an essential tool for localized soft tissue therapy.</p>
      <h2 class="header">Engineering</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">The HYPERSPHERE is engineered to deliver high intensity vibration into the body. The HYPERSPHERE is manufactured using industry best components for the vibration generating motor (set for three optimal speeds), rechargeable long life lithium ion
        battery, digital circuitry and the proprietary eco friend shell providing just the right amount of pressure and vibration. The combination of cutting edge technology and custom design digital circuitry in a compact, simple and familiar shape is
        proving to deliver a winning combination.</p>
